Here are some basic notes on installation of the system.

The files in www/local will not be touched and are meant to house local
configuration and modules/plugins.  However a few files will be touched by
the installer in www/local/config such as the database_settings.inc.php file

REQUIREMENTS:
  An apache server
  A mysql server
  PHP
    php-mysql module

INSTALL:

1. Download the latest file from http://opennetadmin.com/downloads
2. tar -C /opt -zxvf ona-v00.00.00.tar.gz
   This should extract the tar file into /opt/ona

3. Add a symlink in your web server root that points "ona -> /opt/ona/www"
   For example: ln -s /opt/ona/www /var/www/ona

   -or-

   Add this to your apache configuration file in the approrpiate location:

    Alias /ona "/opt/ona/www/"
    <Directory "/opt/ona/www/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

4. touch /var/log/ona.log
5. chmod 666 /var/log/ona.log
6. chown www-data /opt/ona/www/local/config (or whatever your web server user is)
7. Point your broswer to http://<servername>/ona


MISC:

# These steps are not required but are things I might do in the future... They are not recomended at this point

adduser ona
addgroup ona
#   ona:x:1001:1001:OpenNetAdmin,,,:/opt/ona:/bin/false  <-- should look something like this
chown -R ona:ona /opt/ona

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ona/bin

add a symlink of /tftpboot/ona -> /opt/ona/<something>


OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Use something like eaccelerator.
  2. Get the php-gmp modules, or compile php with gmp support.  These are used for extended IP functions.
     They are not required as they are used for functions not fully implemented yet.
