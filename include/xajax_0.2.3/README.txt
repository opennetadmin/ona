1. Introduction

xajax is a PHP library that you can include in your PHP scripts
to provide an easy way for Web pages to call PHP functions or
object methods using Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript And XML). Simply
register one or more functions/methods with the xajax object that
return a proper XML response using the supplied response class, add
a statement in your HTML header to print the Javascript include,
and run a request processor prior to outputting any HTML. Then add
some simple Javascript function calls to your HTML, and xajax takes
care of the rest!

xajax includes a Javascript object to facilitate the communication
between the browser and the server, and it can also be used as a
Javascript library directly to simplify certain DOM and event
manipulations. However, you can definitely choose to use a
dedicated Javascript "engine" of your liking and integrate it with
xajax's client/server communication features in a number of ways.
More tightly-coupled integration will be forthcoming in a future
version of xajax.

2. For More Information

The official xajax Web site is located at:
http://www.xajaxproject.org

Visit the xajax Forums at:
http://community.xajaxproject.org
to keep track of the latest news and participate in the community
discussion.

There is also a wiki with documentation, tips & tricks, and other
information located at:
http://wiki.xajaxproject.org

3. Installation

To run xajax, you need:
* Apache Web Server or IIS for Windows XP/2003 Server
   (other servers may or may not work and are not supported at this
   time)
* PHP 4.3.x or PHP 5.x
* Minimum supported browsers: Internet Explorer 5.5, Firefox 1.0 (or
   equivalent Gecko-based browser), Safari 1.3, Opera 8.5 (older
   versions only work with GET requests)

To install xajax:
Unpack the contents of this archive and copy them to your main Web
site folder. Or if you wish, you can put all of the files in a
dedicated "xajax" folder on your Web server (make sure that you
know what that URL is relative your site pages so you can provide
xajax with the correct installed folder URL). Note that the

"thewall" folder in the "examples" folder needs to be writable by

the Web server for that example to function.

Within the main xajax folder there are two folders: "examples"
and "tests". You should be able to view these PHP pages from your
Web browser and see xajax working in action. If you can view the
pages but the AJAX calls are not working, there may be something
wrong with your server setup or perhaps your browser is not
supported or configured correctly. If worst comes to worst, post
a message in our forums and someone may be able to help you.

4. Documentation

Detailed documentation for the xajax PHP classes is available on
our wiki (URL listed above in section 2), and more is on the way
(particularly in regards to the Javascript component of xajax).
Another good way of learning xajax is to look at the code for the
examples and tests. If you need any help, pop in the forums and
ask for assistance (and the more specific your questions are,
the better the answers will be).

5. Contributing to xajax

xajax is released under the LGPL open source license. If you wish
to contribute to the project or suggest new features, introduce
yourself on the forums or you can e-mail the lead developers at
the addresses listed at the top of this README.

6. Good luck and enjoy!
